# Design System — Refined Scope (v1.0)

> **Purpose**: Build a focused, accessible, and performant Design System for web (React) with smart mobile preparation, avoiding complexity bloat while ensuring enterprise-grade quality.

---

## 1) Goals & Success Criteria

**Business Impact**
* 40% faster feature development via reusable components
* Consistent UX across single brand with light/dark themes
* ≤25% reduction in UI-related support tickets post-adoption

**Technical Excellence**
* WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with automated verification
* <50KB total bundle size for core components
* <60s full build time, <10s incremental changes
* 90%+ developer adoption within 6 months

---

## 2) Core Principles

* **Adoption over perfection**: Developer experience drives usage
* **Performance first**: Bundle size budgets enforced in CI
* **Accessibility by default**: WCAG 2.2 compliance, not afterthought  
* **Simple surface area**: Minimal APIs, predictable behavior
* **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple, evolve based on usage

---

## 3) Architecture (streamlined monorepo)

```
/packages
  /tokens        # DTCG JSON → CSS vars + RN objects
  /icons         # Iconoir SVGs → React components + RN
  /react         # RAC-based components (vanilla-extract styling)  
  /mobile        # Token bridge for future RN development
  /docs          # Storybook 9 + component playground
```

**Key Dependencies**
* **Styling**: vanilla-extract (zero-runtime, type-safe, RN bridge ready)
* **Primitives**: React Aria Components (accessibility, standards)
* **Tokens**: DTCG JSON → Style Dictionary → platform outputs
* **Icons**: Full Iconoir + custom pipeline for brand-specific needs

---

## 4) Scope Definition

### ✅ In Scope (v1.0)

**Core System**
* 8 core components: Button, Input, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Dialog, Tooltip, Alert
* Design tokens (DTCG) for 1 primary brand × light/dark + brand-aware high contrast
* Full Iconoir library + custom SVG pipeline with color & size variants
* Multi-brand theming via CSS variables

**Documentation & Quality**
* Storybook 9 with brand/theme switcher and a11y testing
* TypeScript APIs with comprehensive prop documentation  
* Visual regression testing for all components
* Bundle size monitoring and performance budgets

**Mobile Preparation**
* Token bridge for React Native (StyleSheet integration)
* Foundation for future RN components (post-v1.0)
* Expo compatibility with Dynamic Type support

### ❌ Out of Scope (v1.0)

* Complex data components (Tables, DataGrid, Charts)
* Framework adapters beyond React/React Native
* Full Figma sync automation (manual export with validation)
* Advanced animation system (basic transitions only)
* Enterprise features (RBAC, audit logs, advanced theming)

---

## 5) Technology Stack

**Build & Development**
* **Monorepo**: pnpm + Turbo (simple, fast, proven)
* **Styling**: vanilla-extract + CSS variables + container queries for theming
* **Components**: React 19 + React Aria Components
* **Tokens**: DTCG JSON + Style Dictionary
* **Types**: Strict TypeScript with project references

**Testing & Quality**
* **Unit**: Vitest + Testing Library (>90% coverage)
* **Visual**: Playwright + Storybook Test Runner
* **A11y**: axe-core integration (100% pass rate)
* **Performance**: size-limit + bundle analyzer

**Documentation**
* **Primary**: Storybook 9 (components + playground)
* **API**: TypeDoc generation from TSDoc comments
* **Guides**: MDX for usage patterns and migration

---

## 6) Theming Strategy

### Token Architecture
```
Core Primitives → Brand Variants → Mode Variants
     ↓               ↓               ↓
  Neutral        Brand Colors    Light/Dark/HC
  Spacing        Brand Radius    Contrast Levels
  Typography     Brand Shadows   Motion Prefs
```

### Implementation
* **CSS Variables**: `[data-brand="primary"][data-theme="dark"]`
* **High Contrast**: Manual brand-aware tokens + enhanced borders & focus rings
* **Brand Switching**: Runtime theme switching with persistence
* **Mobile**: Theme objects with same token structure

### Performance
* **Critical CSS**: Core tokens inlined, brand variants loaded async
* **Tree Shaking**: Unused theme variants eliminated at build
* **Caching**: Theme CSS cached separately from components

---

## 7) Floating UI Design Guidelines

### Surface System (No Fluid Glass)
* **`surface/base`**: Opaque backgrounds (96–100% opacity)
* **`surface/raised`**: Subtle elevation for cards and panels (elevation.1)
* **`surface/float`**: Prominent floating elements with inner stroke (elevation.2)

### Elevation Tokens
* **`elevation.0`**: Flat surface (no shadow)
* **`elevation.1`**: Subtle lift - `y=2px blur=8px α≈0.12`
* **`elevation.2`**: Clear floating - `y=6px blur=16px α≈0.14` 
* **`elevation.3`**: Prominent overlay - `y=12px blur=32px α≈0.18`

### Interactive Behavior
* **Hover/Focus**: Components lift with increased elevation
* **Pressed**: Components lower slightly for tactile feedback
* **Focus rings**: Always visible, 3:1 contrast ratio, 2px minimum thickness
* **Motion**: Micro-interactions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Design Principles
* **Solid over transparent**: Opaque surfaces for clarity and accessibility
* **Soft elevation**: Subtle shadows that enhance hierarchy without distraction
* **Clear focus**: Prominent focus indicators for keyboard navigation
* **Consistent depth**: Limited elevation levels for predictable visual hierarchy

---

## 8) Component Standards

### API Design
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Focused, predictable API
<Button variant="primary" size="md" disabled={loading}>
  {loading ? <Spinner /> : 'Submit'}
</Button>

// ❌ Avoid: Too many props, unclear behavior  
<Button isPrimary isLarge showSpinner spinnerPosition="left" theme="dark">
```

### Accessibility Requirements
* All interactive elements: keyboard navigation + focus visible
* ARIA attributes: roles, properties, states as needed
* Color contrast: 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI components
* High contrast: 3:1 focus indicators, increased hit targets
* Motion: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Performance Budgets (per component)
* Bundle size: <5KB gzipped (hard CI limits)
* Runtime: <16ms render time
* Tree shaking: 100% unused variants eliminated
* Dependencies: Tracked via automated bundle analysis

---

## 9) Quality Gates

### Automated Checks (CI)
```yaml
✓ TypeScript compilation (strict mode)
✓ Unit tests >90% coverage
✓ Visual regression (1px threshold, 24 theme snapshots)
✓ A11y compliance (axe-core + manual audits)
✓ Bundle size budgets (hard limits blocking CI)
✓ Bundle analysis (dependency tracking + tree-shaking)
```

### Manual Reviews
* Design review for visual changes
* Code review for API changes
* Structured A11y audits (NVDA, VoiceOver, keyboard, color vision)
* Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## 12) Risk Management

### High Risk Mitigation
* **Adoption barriers**: Champion program + incremental migration paths
* **Performance issues**: Budgets enforced in CI, regular audits
* **A11y regressions**: Automated testing + manual audits
* **Scope creep**: Clear v1.0 boundaries, v2.0 roadmap for requests

### Contingency Plans
* **If vanilla-extract performance fails**: Stitches fallback documented
* **If bundle size exceeds budget**: Component splitting + lazy loading  
* **If RAC becomes blocker**: Radix UI migration path documented
* **If adoption stalls**: Dedicated support team + incentive program
