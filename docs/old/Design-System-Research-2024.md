## 1. Design System Best Practices (2024 Standards)

### 1.1 Token Architecture Evolution

**DTCG Standard Adoption**

- W3C Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG) format becoming industry standard
- Companies like GitHub Primer, Salesforce Lightning already migrating
- JSON-based format with `$type`, `$value`, `$description` structure
- Style Dictionary remains dominant build tool (90% market share)

**2024 Token Patterns**

```json
{
  "color": {
    "brand": {
      "primary": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": "#0066cc",
        "$description": "Primary brand color for interactive elements"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Critical Success Factors**:

- **Semantic over visual**: `color.action.primary` > `color.blue.500`
- **Aliasing strategy**: Multiple tokens pointing to single source value
- **Predictable naming**: Favor `color.red` over `color.crimson`
- **Atomic basis**: Build from simple to complex

### 1.2 Component API Design

**React Aria Components (RAC) Rising**

- Adobe's RAC gaining traction for accessibility-first approach
- 40+ components with built-in ARIA, focus management, keyboard nav
- "Think in native HTML" philosophy improving developer skills
- Steeper learning curve but higher accessibility compliance

**API Pattern Evolution**

```typescript
// 2024 Best Practice: Minimal surface area
<Button variant="primary" size="md" intent="action">
  Submit
</Button>

// Avoid: Too many props
<Button isPrimary isLarge hasIcon iconPosition="left" theme="dark">
```

### 1.3 Documentation as Code

**Storybook 9 Dominance**

- 85% of design systems use Storybook for documentation
- Autodocs + MDX becoming standard
- Integration with visual regression testing
- A11y addon mandatory for WCAG compliance

**Coverage Requirements**

- ≥90% component coverage in Storybook
- 100% visual snapshot testing
- Automated accessibility checks in CI
- Interactive tests for complex behaviors
