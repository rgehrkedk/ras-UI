## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Component Complexity**: Start with simpler components before complex ones
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor bundle size with every addition
- **Testing Complexity**: Implement visual regression incrementally

### Quality Risks
- **Cross-Component Consistency**: Establish design review process
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Manual audits for each component
- **Performance Regressions**: Automated budget enforcement

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Clear boundaries with Sprint 3 planning
- **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize high-impact components first
- **Timeline Management**: Incremental delivery with quality gates
